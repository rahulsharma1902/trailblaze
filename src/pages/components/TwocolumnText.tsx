                    distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of
                    using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as
                    opposed to using &#39;Content here, content here&#39;, making it look like readable English.

                    On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so
                    beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire,
                    that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame
                    belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as
                    saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy
                    to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when
                    nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be
                    welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of
                    duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be
                    repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters
                    to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures.
