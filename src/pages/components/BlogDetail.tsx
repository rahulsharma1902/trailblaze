                                keeping users informed about what is happening within the system. This can be achieved
                                through clear and timely feedback, such as progress indicators, status messages, or
                                notifications. By ensuring that users are always aware of the system&#39;s status, designers can
                                reduce confusion and help users feel more in control.</p>

                            <p className="w_915 mt-4">This principle stresses the need for the system to speak the user&#39;s language,
                                using words, phrases, and concepts that are familiar to the user rather than technical
                                jargon. The system should follow real-world conventions, making information appear naturally
                                and logically. This approach helps users understand the interface more efficiently and
                                reduces the cognitive load..</p>

                                principle includes providing users with easily accessible exit points, undo and redo
                                options, and the ability to backtrack without encountering penalties. By offering user
                                control and freedom, designers can prevent frustration and empower users to interact with
                                the system on their own terms.</p>

                            <p className="w_915 mt-4">Consistency in design ensures that users do not have to wonder whether
                                different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. The system should follow
                                platform conventions and maintain uniformity in design elements, such as color schemes,
                                typography, and layout. Heuristic reviews help ensure adherence to consistency and
                                standards, allowing users to predict outcomes and improving the overall user experience.</p>

                            <p className="w_915 mt-3">Designers should strive to prevent errors before they occur. This can be
                                achieved by eliminating error-prone conditions or providing users with a confirmation option
                                before they commit to an action. Effective error prevention reduces the likelihood of user
                                mistakes and enhances the system&#39;s reliability.</p>

                                One of the primary advantages of heuristic evaluation is its cost-effectiveness. Unlike user
                                testing, which requires recruiting participants and conducting extensive sessions, heuristic
                                assessment can be performed by a small group of usability experts. This method reduces the
                                need for large budgets and resources while still providing valuable insights into a
                                product&#39;s usability. Additionally, identifying and fixing usability issues early in the
                                design process prevents costly redesigns later, saving time and money.

                                Heuristic analysis allows for the early detection of usability issues, often before the
                                product reaches the user testing phase. By applying established heuristic principles,
                                evaluators can identify potential problems during the design stage, enabling designers to
                                address these issues proactively. This early intervention ensures that major usability flaws
                                are resolved before they impact the user experience, leading to a more refined and
                                user-friendly final product.
